This folder contains a Matlab implementation of the quadcopter dynamics equations in
([Bouabdallah et al. 2004](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/97532/files/325.pdf)),
extended to work with general multi-copter (quad, hex, octo) configurations.  The
only dependency is NumPy (not OpenAI gym or other packages).
